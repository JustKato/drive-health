## About

## Disclaimer

This software is only meant to run on linux, it's something I threw together all at once in one sitting without really thinking about structure or even caring about anything but making it work.

It's actually meant to run on my own server just so I can track the temperature of my harddrives in a live environment, I just want this service to run, record the status of the harddrives, and be able via my VPN to access it in a private manner, it's not meant to be dockerized, it's not meant to be ran in a VM, it's meant to be ran either as a `service` or in a [screen](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git) in the background.

It's not really meant to run all the time or anything like that, I just wanted to write this disclaimer, feel free to use the code any way you want to :)
